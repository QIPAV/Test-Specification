\subsection{Research Testing}
Research testing is related to proving or disproving the hypothesis posed by FFI.
The hypothesis is as following ”A Variable Pitch Quadcopter can provide a more accurate and stable landing compared to a Fixed Pitch Quadcopter”. \\
\\
Given that a stable FPQ and VPQ is developed, these objectives may be tested:
\begin {table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline 
        \textbf{Objective:} & \textbf{Suggested Test:}\\
        \hline 
        Differences in landing accuracy & Multiple landing experiments on fixed spot\\ \hline
        Differences in landing stability & Multiple landing experiments on fixed spot\\
        &   Qualisys \\\hline
        Differences in flight with turbulent environment & Multiple flight experiments with disturbances\\ \hline
        Differences in response time regarding thrust & Loop 800 \\
        change & \\
        \hline 
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent
Given that no stable FPQ and VPQ is developed, these objectives may be tested:
\begin {table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline 
        \textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Suggested Test}\\
        \hline 
        Differences in response time regarding thrust &  Test Rig with loop script\\
        change between FPM and VPM &      \\\hline
        Differences in efficiency between FPM and & Test Rig with weight and external power supply\\
        VPM (g/W) & \\
        \hline 
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

  The most important question, and the one FFI wants an answer to:  ”Canvariable pitch provide a more stable landing than fixed pitch”?.To  test  this,  we  need  to  land  the  two  quadcopters  in  similar  environment  multiple  times.   There  mighteven be a need to inflict with an outer disturbance such as wind to get useful data.Additionally,  we  also  want  to  test  differences  between  the  two  solutions  in  a  test  rig.   In  that  way,  wecan answer if the response time is really faster on variable pitch than on fixed pitch

 Spørsmål FFI behøver svar på:
 ¨
 Mulighet for bedre responstid
 Mulighet for mer stabil kontroll
 Undersøke om variable pitch kan gi mer stabil landing
