  The most important question, and the one FFI wants an answer to:  ”Canvariable pitch provide a more stable landing than fixed pitch”?.To  test  this,  we  need  to  land  the  two  quadcopters  in  similar  environment  multiple  times.   There  mighteven be a need to inflict with an outer disturbance such as wind to get useful data.Additionally,  we  also  want  to  test  differences  between  the  two  solutions  in  a  test  rig.   In  that  way,  wecan answer if the response time is really faster on variable pitch than on fixed pitch

 Spørsmål FFI behøver svar på:
 ¨
 Mulighet for bedre responstid
 Mulighet for mer stabil kontroll
 Undersøke om variable pitch kan gi mer stabil landing
