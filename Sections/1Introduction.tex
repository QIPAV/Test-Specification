The Test Plan contains information about the purpose of testing, Test Strategy and how we will conduct our testing to verify our project. In Scrum, testing is done continuously in every Sprint. In an Agile mythology like Scrum, each Sprint focuses only a few User Stories or Backlog Items at the time. In a perfect Scrum Team all Team Members create and performs tests. Testing is done throughout the projects life-cycle, and it is important to test early and often.\\
