\section{Introduction}
The following document contains the Test Specification for this research project. The purpose of the Test Specification is to create a description of what has been tested throughout the project. Testing is crucial to gain the appropriate data to justify our research. This document contains information about the purpose of testing, Test Strategy and how tests will be conducted to verify the project. In Scrum, testing is done continuously in every Sprint. In an Agile mythology like Scrum, each Sprint focuses only on a few User Stories or Backlog Items at the time. In a perfect Scrum Team all Team Members create and performs tests. Testing is done throughout the projects life-cycle, and it is important to test early and often.\\

Testing will be divided into two categories; testing for User Stories and testing for research purposes. Research testing is directly related to proving or disproving the hypothesis posed by FFI. When User Stories are tested it is a form of experimental testing. The User Stories are not always directly linked up with the research, but the result or information obtained from these tests are important to verify and to further develop the system so that it is ready for the research testing. Also testing User Stories helps to verify that Sprint goals are met. \\
